This file produces a
day_level_cluster_level_medical_center_level_normalized_DataFrame_dictionary (the last few rows in a DataFrame with be the test days for automated model selection) which will be later fed into DataCluseteringAndNormalization (with the option of not doing clustering and we test this option in the unittest of this part). The result of the previous part will be fed into data windowing which will give us day_level_cluster_level_medical_center_level_input_output_DataFrame_list_dictionary.
